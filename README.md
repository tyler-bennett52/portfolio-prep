## Tyler's Portfolio


1. Full-Stack Web Developer
2. Proud Air Force Veteran transitioning to web-development
3. I'm an aspiring front end developer who graduates from a full-stack development course in May. My background is in Arabic-to-English translation for the Air Force, where I learned how to be a part of diverse teams with dynamic challenges. I love overcoming the challenges that come with development and that there's always an oppurtunity to learn more. I'm most looking forward to building something new.
4. Excited about tech because it forces me to think in a totally new way, and it has made me realize that almost every problem is solvable.
